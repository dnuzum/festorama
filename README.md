#Festorama Hackathon!

##About
It's festival time. Futurama style. Here's a little ditty to help you choose which ones to go to, and more details on each. Maybe there's a Bending festival!
Made in a handful of hours by these swell humans [Navya Lakkaraju](https://github.com/navyayvan), [Derek Nuzum](https://github.com/dnuzum), [Cassandra Aguiar](https://github.com/cassicakes), and [Jonathan Stevenson](https://github.com/JonathanAndrew).


##Technologies used
* It's M.E.A.N. baby!

##Approach
* Freaked out
* Finalized idea
* Created master git repo, built basic app, and forked/ cloned for all group members
* Assigned front and back devs
* Bashed out heads into our lap-tops till this little gem came about


##User stories 
As a user, I like festivals.
As a user I would like a list of a bunch of different festivals all together, with information on each.
As a user I like Futurama.  
As a user I wany my app to be plastered with Bender. 


## Learning Experiences and Ideas for Future Development
* We NAILED not having merge conflicts on Github
* We would of liked to implement profiles for users to save their favorites and a way for them to communicate with each other
* Working in a group rules!
